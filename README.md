## 🚀 About the Project — Delhivery Feature Engineering
This repository contains my **Delhivery Feature Engineering** project, where I analyzed and transformed raw logistics data from Delhivery’s e-commerce operations to create meaningful features for predictive modeling and business decision-making.  

### 🔍 Project Highlights:
- **Data Understanding:** Explored shipment, delivery, and customer data to understand patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Creation:** Built new variables such as delivery delays, route distances, shipment durations, and traffic-adjusted times.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized formats, and removed anomalies.
- **Business Insight:** Identified key factors affecting delivery performance and proposed operational improvements.

**Skills Used:**  
`Python` | `Pandas` | `NumPy` | `Matplotlib` | `Seaborn` | `Feature Engineering` | `EDA`

## 📊 Example Insights
- **Peak Delays:** Shipments during the festive season had 35% higher delays.
- **Route Efficiency:** Shorter urban routes were consistently on-time, while long-haul rural deliveries faced frequent delays.
- **Top Features:** Distance, shipment weight, and pickup time were strong predictors of delivery delays.
